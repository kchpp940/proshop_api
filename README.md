# Proshop API

Proshop API is a RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework. It is the backend for the [Proshop](https://proshop-eshop.web.app/). Check out the [frontend repository](https://github.com/justicenyaga/proshop) for more details.

The project was inspired by [Dennis Ivanov](https://www.dennisivy.com/) and [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/). I followed their tutorial on udemy [Django with React | An Ecommerce Website](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-with-react-an-ecommerce-website/). I made some changes to the project to make it more interesting and to learn more about Django and React.

The API is hosted on Azure and can be accessed through this [link](https://proshop-eshop.azurewebsites.net/). The link will take you to the API home page which contains the various endpoints. A more detailed documentation will be provided soon.

## Features

The API has most of the features you would expect to find in an ecommerce web application. Some of the features include:

- User authentication
- Product reviews and ratings
- Product search feature
- Making and managing orders
- Admin product management
- Admin user management
- Admin order details page
- PayPal integration
- Unified media storage service for product and category images

## Media Storage Configuration

The project uses a unified media storage service that supports both local file system storage and S3-compatible cloud storage (DigitalOcean Spaces, AWS S3).

### Local Storage (Development)

By default, media files are stored locally in the `media/` directory:

- `MEDIA_ROOT`: `BASE_DIR / media/`
- `MEDIA_URL`: `/media/`

### Cloud Storage (Production)

To enable S3-compatible cloud storage, set the following environment variables:

```bash
USE_S3_STORAGE=True
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://your-region.digitaloceanspaces.com
```

### Upload Configuration

- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Allowed extensions: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`
- Upload directories:
  - Product images: `media/products/`
  - Category images: `media/categories/`
